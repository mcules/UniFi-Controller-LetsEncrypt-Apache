# UniFi Controller SSL using Apache Proxy + Let's Encrypt

A guide to obtain a free, valid SSL for UniFi Controller running on port 80/443 rather than the default 8080/8443. This method actually uses an SSL'd Apache proxy rather than dealing with the complexity of updating UniFi's built in SSL.

# Debian 8 Instructions:

## Install UniFi Controller

	sudo apt-get update -y
	sudo apt-get upgrade -y
	echo "deb http://www.ubnt.com/downloads/unifi/debian unifi5 ubiquiti" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubnt.list 
	apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv C0A52C50
	apt-get update -y
	apt-get install unifi -y


## Install Let's Encrypt certbot

	echo 'deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian unstable main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/unstable.list
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install python-certbot-apache -t unstable


## Run the Certbot wizard, specify your domain like unifi.example.com, and email address
	certbot --apache

## Add cronjob to auto renew cert every Monday at 2:30am
	sudo crontab -e
	30 2 * * 1 /usr/bin/certbot renew >> /var/log/le-renew.log

## Add modules to Apache for Proxying HTTP/HTTPS to 8080 and 8443
	mkdir /var/www/unifi
	a2enmod proxy
	a2enmod proxy_http
	a2enmod proxy_wstunnel
	a2enmod ssl

	service apache2 restart

	nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf

## Example of 000-default.conf, change unifi.example.com to your site:

	<VirtualHost *:80>
		# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
		# the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
		# redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
		# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
		# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
		# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
		# However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
		ServerName unifi.example.com

		ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
		DocumentRoot /var/www/unifi

		# Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
		# error, crit, alert, emerg.
		# It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
		# modules, e.g.
		#LogLevel info ssl:warn

		ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
		CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

		# For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
		# enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
		# include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
		# following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
		# after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
		#Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf

		<Directory /var/www/unifi>
			Options None
			AllowOverride None
			Require all granted
		</Directory>
	</VirtualHost>

## Example of 000-default-le-ssl.conf, change unifi.example.com to your site:

	SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/unifi.example.com/fullchain.pem
	SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/unifi.example.com/privkey.pem
	Include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf


	</VirtualHost>

## Restart Apache for changes to take effect
	service apache2 restart
